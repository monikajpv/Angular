        <h2>External CSS</h2>
        <p>In external CSS, we link the web pages to the external .css file. It is created by text editor. <br>
            The CSS is more efficient method for styling a website. 
            By editing the .css file, we can change the whole site at once.</p>

        <h2>Pros of External CSS:</h2>
        Our files have a cleaner structure and smaller in size.<br>
        We use the same .css file for multiple web pages in external CSS.

        <h2>Cons of External CSS:</h2>
        The pages cannot be delivered correctly before the external CSS is loaded.<br>
         In External CSS, uploading many CSS files can increase the download time of a website.
